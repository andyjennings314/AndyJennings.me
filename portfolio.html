                        I have worked with JATO on their flagship Carspecs platform since December 2013. For the most part, this involved creating, customising, and bugfixing web portals for various
                    clients, with various combinations of CSS3, jQuery, and AngularJS. I also contributed application logic to the Development version of the site, and helped maintain legacy
                    versions of Carspecs using c#.</p>

                        Unfortunately, since Carspecs relies on proprietory code, I can't share it with you, so you'll have to enjoy the screenshots of my favourite customised portals.

                        Between May 2012 and December 2013, I was the front end developer for The Entertainer's online team. This involved creating custom brand and category pages from
                        Photoshop wireframes, and circumnavigating the limitations of the CMS with heavy jQuery use. Many of the pages I created have been since removed, but you can browse

                    For my wedding, I built a simple Bootstrap-based site to act as a centralised point for information about the wedding. Afterwards, it was modified to act as a repository
                    for photos, videos, and articles about the big day.

                        As a wedding gift for friends getting married in June 2016, I offered to build a similar site to Andy And Tania.
                        The couple required a dual-language site, and initially requested a password-protected site. I therefore implemented a simple AngularJS framework to handle
                        content navigation and dual language support, as well as adding a new colour scheme to the existing Bootstrap framework.

                        As an exercise in parsing data from APIs, I created a weather widget that scrapes your location with one API, then uses that to get the weather from another API.

The brand's first real hit was the O.Time, which was originally called the "Organic Time." I reviewed the <a href="http://www.usarmygermany.com/postinfo.asp">rolex replica sale</a> three years ago here. Before that, I was actually the first person to ever cover the Dietrich brand online six years ago. The O.Time watch was <a href="http://www.ptwatches.co.uk/">replica watches uk</a> with a Japanese movement at a price point of about $1,300. It was intended to be a more risque and intellectual version of the SevenFriday brand but with the same movement. I still like the <a href="http://www.luxuryrex.org.uk/">replica watches sale</a> especially because of how comfortable it is, but I don't find myself wearing it frequently. Assuming I ever get my hands on a production version of the <a href="http://www.healyourlife.co.uk/self.htm">rolex replica</a> I think the story will be different this is a pre-production prototype.</div>
