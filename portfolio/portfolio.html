                        I have worked with JATO on their flagship Carspecs platform since December 2013. For the most part, this involved creating, customising, and bugfixing web portals for various
                    clients, with various combinations of SASS-lead CSS3, AngularJS, and jQuery. I also contributed application logic to the Development version of the site, and helped maintain legacy
                    versions of Carspecs using c#.</p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, since Carspecs relies on proprietory code, I can't share it with you, so you'll have to enjoy the screenshots of my favourite customised portals.

                        Between May 2012 and December 2013, I was the in-house front end developer for The Entertainer's online team. This involved creating custom brand and category pages from
                        Photoshop wireframes, and circumnavigating the limitations of the CMS with heavy jQuery use. Unfortunately, they have since replatformed their site, so many if not all of the pages I created have been since removed.

                    For my wedding, I built a simple Bootstrap-based site to act as a centralised point for information about the wedding. Afterwards, it was modified to act as a repository
                    for photos, videos, and articles about the big day.

                        As a wedding gift for friends getting married in June 2016, I offered to build a similar site to Andy And Tania.
                        The couple required a dual-language site, and initially requested a password-protected site. I therefore implemented a simple AngularJS framework to handle
                        content navigation and dual language support, as well as adding a new colour scheme to the existing Bootstrap framework.

                        My brother requested a simple site with a image portfolio and contact details for his modelling career. I took the opportunity to create a one-page full bleed site, with
                        a simple responsive layout.

                        As an exercise in parsing data from APIs, I created a weather widget that scrapes your location with one API, then uses that to get the weather from another API.
