                <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far... no, scratch that.</p>

                <p>About twenty years ago, in a small house in the countryside, I made my first website. It looked terrible, and all the images were made in MS Paint, but it was mine.</p>

                <p>Then I made another, and it looked slightly better. And then I did that again, and I've been doing that ever since.</p>

                <p>Making cool websites has been something I've always loved doing, even before I realised I wanted to be a web developer six months after graduating with a Philosophy degree.
                Thankfully, I've been able to make front end development my career with some awesome companies, and I have even done some cool projects on the side (take a look at them under "My Work").</p>

                <p>AnguarJS, SASS-lead CSS3, and Bootstrap are my main weapons of choice, but I'm also good in jQuery and raw JavaScript. Plus, I'm a quick learner, and
                always eager to learn new skills to make my sites look good.</p>

                <p>When the code editor shuts for the night, I like indie video games, am reasonably good at cooking, and even write the odd short story occasionally.</p>
                <p>But I'm not <i>that</i> fond of Star Wars. Where did you get that idea?</p>
